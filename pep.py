"""
- modules should have short, all-lowercase names;
- class names should be in the CapWords style;
- most variables and function names should be lowercase_with_underscores;
- constants (variables that never change value) should be CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES;
- names that would clash with Python keywords (such as 'class' or 'if') should have a trailing underscore.

#Which choice is PEP 8-compliant as the name of a class?
# R: MyClassName

#Other PEP 8 suggestions include the following:
"""
- lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters;
- 'from module import *' should be avoided;
- there should only be one statement per line.
